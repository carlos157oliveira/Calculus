# Calculus

If you are an undergradutate student or simply an affectionate to math, you might find useful this application to calculate derivatives, integrals and plot results within a given range.

## Where to find

The application is distributed by flathub. [Click here for install page.](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.carlos157oliveira.Calculus)

You will find other cool stuff there too!

## How to use

### Interface

After you have first opened the application, you will see three fields.

- The main field is the expression upon which you want to operate;
- The second field is the variable with which the operation will be done. For example, use ***x*** if the operation is **differentiate with respect to *x*** (or **integrate**);
- The last is the chosen operation: differentiate or integrate.

### Simple operation

Put the function of interest in the main field.

Type in the variable in the second field (the operation will be done with it).

Select between **integration** or **differentiation** (this is the default) and hit the **Operate** button!

If the **operation variable** is changed to ***y***, then the differentiation of the last expression is zero because it is constant with respect to ***y***. ![changing variable](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/carlos157oliveira/Calculus/gh-pages/img/4.png)

### Gotchas

The back-end of the application is made with [SymPy](https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html). There are some interesting things like:

- You must separate the variables with **\*** (asterisk), don't omit this symbol or it will be understood that the variable is named with more than one letter. Example: ***abc*** mean variable with name "abc" and not value ***a*** times ***b*** times ***c***;
- The same apply to function. You can name a function with more than one letter, but remember to separate it from the expression using an algebraic operator;
- If the function is unknown to SymPy, it will display an integral or differentiation symbol and the plot functionality won't be able to resolve the expression (image below show a unknown function **xsin**, which isn't **x\*sin** because the operator isn't implicitly adopted);

- Sometimes, the result of an integral can be displayed using a function that has inside another integral.

### Plotting expressions

The application has this bonus feature which is plot the original expression and the result that is displayed! Although it needs to be an univariable expression. If the expression is multivariable, consider substituting for the variables that won't be used their numerical fixed values.

After a result has been stored by the application, use the plot button.

Choose a range, the colors of the lines or leave the configuration as it is. Hit the **Plot** button and *voil√†*. In the example below, the graphic of sinusoidal functions.
